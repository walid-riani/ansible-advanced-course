# üß± Blockinfile Automation (Add Web Content)

Automates insertion of a multi-line content block into an existing file using Ansible‚Äôs **`blockinfile`** module.  
This playbook targets `/var/www/html/index.html` on the `web1` node and ensures the file is properly owned by Apache.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Add a content block **at the beginning** of the `/var/www/html/index.html` file.
- Ensure:
  - The block text is added only once (idempotent).
  - File owner and group are both `apache`.
  - File permissions are `0644`.
